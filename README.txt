quick little read me
run from main.py
possible arguments:
    -a : just prints run automatic on the log file
    -m : just prints run mannuel on the log file
    -ag : will get all the players total gold contributions
    -ng : will not get any players total raid gold conributions
    -cg : will only get the players currently in the clans, total gold contribution

if you are getting an error like:
 "accessDenied.invalidIp" and "Invalid authorization API key does not allow access from my IP"

You need to make a clash of clans api account and make  key from there using you ip address
https://developer.clashofclans.com/#/
then put the key in the config.json file in the keys array




I plan on redoing this project in the summer of 2023, and making a proper read me and jazz and make it easier for other peopel to use

feel free to email me if your trying to use this before i get around to redoing the whole thing and you are getting errors
